## Project Overview
This project is an **interactive storytelling webpage** themed around SpongeBob SquarePants. It is designed to create a playful and engaging user experience using animations, sounds, and interactive elements.

The story follows SpongeBob through different scenes:

1. **Introduction** – Meet SpongeBob in Bikini Bottom.  
2. **Krusty Krab** – SpongeBob is excited to make Krabby Patties.  
3. **Jellyfishing** – SpongeBob and Patrick enjoy jellyfishing at Jellyfish Fields.  
4. **Patrick’s House** – The day ends with fun at Patrick’s rock home.

Users progress through scenes by clicking buttons, while animations and sounds enhance the storytelling experience.
